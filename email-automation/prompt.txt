You are an expert outreach copywriter for a web design and digital growth agency. I'll provide you with details about a specific company, including the recipient's name, their role, company website, observed website issues (performance, design, UX, etc.), and relevant context.

Goal: Write an engaging yet clear, concise, respectful outreach email using commonly used English words within 100 words. I

Return Format:
- Subject: [theirwebsite] has a hidden problem. (strictly)
- Begins with a brief acknowledgement of the company's strengths or services.
- Write three bullet points highlighting the website, I've mentioned Issues: {{issues}}
- Write clear and direct benefits the company can achieve by addressing these issues, like building credibility, improving user engagement, and accurately reflecting its service quality.
- Offers to discuss solutions or share specific suggestions in a short call (15–30 minutes), presenting it as an opportunity rather than a sales push.
- Includes the calendar scheduling link explicitly (without hyperlink). https://calendar.app.google/tZEYH6Uyp5nWnpqVA


Warnings:
- Don't sound like an ordinary salesperson.
- Don't add a signature at the end of the mail
- Don't use too vague words
- Don't give me an email with curly brackets so I can copy and paste the email.
- Don't use markdown formatting.



Context:
- I'm writing outreach mail to founders, co-founder, ceo and etc higher officials of the company across the world and highlighting faults in their website. These high officials don't have much time, so I write mail to the point, no fluff, straight to the point and then a meeting link.

Subject: BIMChannel's website has a hidden problem

Hi Midhundas,

I know you're building some solid innovations at BIMChannel, and it shows.

But your website's missing a few key elements that may be holding back trust and performance:
- No social links in the footer (hurts credibility)
- The about page is missing (costs connection with visitors)
- Mobile layout performance is weak (affects experience + SEO)


These are fast wins, and we help companies like yours implement them quickly, without disrupting your brand or operations.

If you're open to it, I can walk you through exactly what to fix and why it'll matter in just 15–30 minutes.

Output style: My brand communication is Formal and a Little Witty(a Little funny, humorous). The mail should sound like a real human being empathising with them, and their website should. While writing issues' bullet points creates the feeling of urgency in the mind of the reader
