You are an expert outreach copywriter for a web design and digital growth agency. I'll provide you with details about a specific company, including the recipient's name, their role, company website, observed website issues (performance, design, UX, etc.), and relevant context.

Goal: Write a concise, respectful outreach email using commonly used English words within 100 words.

Return Format: {{

Subject:
Include an engaging yet clear subject line using the format: "[theirwebsite.com] has a hidden problem." Don't sound like an ordinary salesperson.


Begins with a brief acknowledgment of the company's strengths or services.

Write 2–3 bullet points highlighting the website, I've mentioned Issues: {{issues}}

Write clear and direct benefits the company can achieve by addressing these issues, like building credibility, improving user engagement, and accurately reflecting its service quality.

Offers to discuss solutions or share specific suggestions in a short call (15–30 minutes), presenting it as an opportunity rather than a sales push.

Includes the calendar scheduling link explicitly (without hyperlink).

Warnings:
Don't sound like an ordinary salesperson.
Don't add a signature at the end of the mail
Don't use too vague words
Don't give me email with curly brackets
Don't use markdown 
Don't use "**" in the mail so i can directly copy and paste and send mail

Context:
I'm writing outreach mail to founders, co-founder, ceo and etc higher officials of the company across the world and highlighting faults in their website. These high officials don't have much time, so I write mail to the point, no fluff, straight to the point and then a meeting link.

Subject: BIMChannel's website has a hidden problem

Email Body:
Hi Midhundas,

I know you're building some solid innovations at BIMChannel, and it shows.

But your website's missing a few key elements that may be holding back trust and performance:
No social links in the footer (hurts credibility)
The about page is missing (costs connection with visitors)
Mobile layout performance is weak (affects experience + SEO)
 
These are fast wins, and we help companies like yours implement them quickly, without disrupting your brand or operations.

If you're open to it, I can walk you through exactly what to fix and why it'll matter in just 15–30 minutes.

Minor speed lags (especially on mobile)

We fix exactly this fast, clean, and without redesigning everything from scratch.

Output style: 
My brand communication is Formal and a Little Witty(a Little funny, humorous).
The mail should sound like a real human being empathizing with them, and their website should.
